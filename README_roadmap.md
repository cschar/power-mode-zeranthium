future TODO:

- BUILDUP_MONITOR, where you hit different thresholds
  - based on threshold, different SOUNDS/EFFECTS HAPPEN
  - thresholds can be based on wpm
  - can be based on typing X characters to achieve threshold 2
     - then type Y characters more to achieve threshold 3
     - then resets back to threshold 1  

- Add PackLoader support for all settings, provide template for how to write config file
- Ability to 'export' all settings as saved package (pngs/mp3s/json)

- code explorer (e.g. wave collapse for dungeon background)
---- when you type it lights up background, e.g. icnreasing alpha from 0->0.1

- code explorer v2 
---- typing lights up dungeion PLUS sends out ai units to battle spiders etc.. LOL
 
- plant growth using wave collapse function?


           "fontset"
BELOW NEED "FONTSET" type datatype;      
  
- 36daysofType callout https://mantissa.xyz/resources
- 36daysofType COMPLETE replacement of all characters LOL
   - would require minimum fontsize?
   - or 'master font set 100x100px' would 'generate' font
   size set for current fontsize e.g. 14pt
   would show a 'genereating font' after setting is set

- TOKEN callout with decoration above
  - can choose 'holder' animation/image
  - can choose 'font' to display each char typed
